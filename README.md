# goeuro
Java Task for goeuro company


I've used different libraries:

- http://www.json.org/java/index.html: for JSON manipulating
- http://www.jcabi.com/: for the REST client
- http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/: for CSV file writing

All the jars are in the lib directory

The output of the computation is stored in the "data.csv" file in the main directory.

Tested with:

- Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_20-b26)
- Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.20-b23, mixed mode)
