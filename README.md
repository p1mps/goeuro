# goeuro
Java Task for goeuro


I've used different libraries:

- http://www.json.org/java/index.html: for JSON manipulating
- http://www.jcabi.com/: for the REST client
- http://opencsv.sourceforge.net/: for CSV file writing

All the jars are in the lib directory

The output of the computation is stored in the "data.csv" file in the main directory.

To run the application from the command line:

- java -jar GoEuroTest.jar "STRING"


Tested with:

- Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_20-b26)
- Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.20-b23, mixed mode)
